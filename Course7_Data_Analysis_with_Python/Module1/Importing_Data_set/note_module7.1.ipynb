    "# Course7: Data Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "## Module1: Importing Data Sets\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform data analysis in Python effectively, several key libraries are essential. These libraries can be categorized into three main groups: Scientific Computing Libraries, Data Visualization Libraries, and Algorithmic Libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Scientific Computing Libraries\n",
    "- **Pandas:** Provides data structures and tools for efficient data manipulation and analysis. Its primary structure, the DataFrame, allows for easy indexing and access to structured data.\n",
    "- **NumPy:** Utilizes arrays for inputs and outputs, enabling fast array processing. It can be extended for matrix operations with minimal coding changes.\n",
    "- **SciPy:** Offers functions for advanced mathematical problems and data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Visualization Libraries\n",
    "- **Matplotlib:** The most well-known library for creating graphs and plots. It allows for highly customizable visual representations of data.\n",
    "- **Seaborn:** Built on Matplotlib, this library makes it easy to generate a variety of plots, including heat maps, time series, and violin plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Algorithmic Libraries\n",
    "- **Scikit-learn:** Contains tools for statistical modeling, such as regression, classification, and clustering. It is built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "- **Statsmodels:** Enables users to explore data, estimate statistical models, and perform statistical tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "These libraries collectively offer a comprehensive toolkit for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and the development of machine learning models in Python.\n"

    "# To Read and Manipulate Data in Python Using the Pandas Package\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition with Pandas [การอ่าน Data โดยใช้ Pandas]\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Understanding Data Format and Path\n",
    "- **Format:** The way data is encoded, such as CSV, JSON, XLSX, HDF, etc.\n",
    "- **Path:** Location where the data is stored, either locally or online.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps to Read Data Using Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Reading CSV Files\n",
    "- **Example Dataset:** We have a dataset of used cars stored online, where each row represents one data point with various properties separated by commas, indicating a CSV format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Code to Read CSV Data\n",
    "- **Import the Pandas library:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define a variable with the file path:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "file_path = 'http://example.com/used_cars.csv'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use the `read_csv` method to read the data into a Pandas DataFrame:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(file_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Handling Data Without Headers [set header = None]\n",
    "- If the dataset has no column headers, set the `header` parameter to `None` in the `read_csv` method.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df = pd.read_csv(file_path, header=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Previewing Data\n",
    "- **Use `df.head(n)` to display the first `n` rows:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.head(5))  # First 5 rows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use `df.tail(n)` to display the last `n` rows:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(df.tail(5))  # Last 5 rows\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Assigning Column Names [if we want to add column head name]\n",
    "- If column names are in a separate file or list, assign them to the DataFrame.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "headers = ['column1', 'column2', 'column3']  # Example column names\n",
    "df.columns = headers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Exporting Data to CSV\n",
    "- Use the `to_csv` method to save the DataFrame to a new CSV file.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "df.to_csv('path/to/automobile.csv', index=False)\n",
    "```\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Lesson Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dataset Structure:**\n",
    "  - Each line in a dataset is a row, and commas separate the values.\n",
    "  - To understand the data, you must analyze the attributes for each column of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Python Libraries:**\n",
    "  - Python libraries are collections of functions and methods that facilitate various functionalities without writing code from scratch and are categorized into Scientific Computing, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning Algorithms.\n",
    "  - Many data science libraries are interconnected; for instance, Scikit-learn is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reading Data with Pandas:**\n",
    "  - The data format and the file path are two key factors for reading data with Pandas.\n",
    "  - The `read_csv` method in Pandas can read files in CSV format into a Pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Types in Pandas:**\n",
    "  - Pandas has unique data types like object, float, int, and datetime.\n",
    "  - Use the `dtype` method to check each column’s data type; misclassified data types might need manual correction.\n",
    "  - Knowing the correct data types helps apply appropriate Python functions to specific columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Statistical Summary with `describe()`:**\n",
    "  - Using the `describe()` method provides count, mean, standard deviation, min, max, and quartile ranges for numerical columns.\n",
    "  - You can also use `include='all'` as an argument to get summaries for object-type columns.\n",
    "  - The statistical summary helps identify potential issues like outliers needing further attention.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Overview with `info()`:**\n",
    "  - Using the `info()` method gives an overview of the top and bottom 30 rows of the DataFrame, useful for quick visual inspection.\n",
    "  - Some statistical metrics may return \"NaN,\" indicating missing values, and the program can’t calculate statistics for that specific data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Database Connections:**\n",
    "  - Python can connect to databases through specialized code, often written in Jupyter notebooks.\n",
    "  - SQL Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and Python DB APIs (most often used) facilitate the interaction between Python and the DBMS.\n",
    "  - SQL APIs connect to DBMS with one or more API calls, build SQL statements as a text string, and use API calls to send SQL statements to the DBMS and retrieve results and statuses.\n",
    "  - DB-API, Python's standard for interacting with relational databases, uses connection objects to establish and manage database connections and cursor objects to run queries and scroll through the results.\n",
    "  - Connection Object methods include the `cursor()`, `commit()`, `rollback()`, and `close()` commands.\n",
    "  - You can import the database module, use the Connect API to open a connection, and then create a cursor object to run queries and fetch results.\n",
    "  - Remember to close the database connection to free up resources.\n",
