    "A model or estimator can be thought of as a mathematical equation used to predict a value given one or more other values, relating one or more independent variables or features to dependent variables. For example, you input a car model's highway miles per gallon as the independent variable or feature. The output of the model or dependent variable is the price. Usually, the more relevant data you have, the more accurate your model is. For example, you input multiple independent variables or features to your model. Therefore, your model may predict a more accurate price for the car.\n",

You want to use your model to determine the price of two cars, one pink, one red. If your model's independent variables or features do not include color, your model will predict the same price for cars that may sell for much less. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Higher-Order Polynomials and Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "While higher-order polynomials can capture more complex patterns, they also introduce the risk of overfitting. Overfitting occurs when the model becomes too specific to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data.\n",

In the next section, we'll explore more advanced methods for model evaluation."
