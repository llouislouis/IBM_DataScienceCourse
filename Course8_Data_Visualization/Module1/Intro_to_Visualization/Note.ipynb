    "# Types of Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to types of plots. After watching this video, you'll be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore different types of plots available for visualizing data.\n",
    "- Identify the characteristics and appropriate use cases for each type of plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we know, data visualization represents data using visual formats like graphs, charts, and maps. It effectively communicates information, trends, and insights concisely. It also uncovers patterns, identifies trends, and simplifies complex information for easy understanding. Let's now explore the different types of plots:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Line Plot\n",
    "A line plot, also known as a line chart, displays data as a series of data points connected by straight lines. Line plots display trends, such as stock market fluctuations or temperature changes over time. They compare datasets with a continuous independent variable like age or time. Line plots illustrate cause and effect relationships, such as sales revenue changes based on marketing budget. They also visualize continuous data, like height measurements over time. Line plots can be misleading if the scales on the axes are not carefully chosen to reflect the data accurately. The line plot shows a downfall in immigration trends in 1998; however, if you correct the scale on the y-axis to start with zero, as in this plot, you'll see that the actual trend is not that alarming.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bar Plot\n",
    "A bar plot, also known as a bar chart, displays data using rectangular bars, where the height or length of the bars represents the magnitude of the data. The bars can be oriented either vertically or horizontally. A vertically oriented bar chart is often referred to as a vertical bar chart or a column chart. If you're looking for an effective way to compare data, bar plots are ideal for comparing different categories or groups. They excel with discrete data, like comparing sales revenue by product. They show how different categories contribute to the whole and rankings, such as sales percentage or budget allocation. Bar plots can visualize data that you can easily rank, like displaying the bestselling books in the market. Their simplicity and interpretability make them favored for data visualization. Inaccurate bar choices or axis scales can lead to misleading plots. In this bar plot, the y-axis starting at six makes the difference between the values in 1995 and 1998 seem larger than it actually is. However, when the y-axis starts at zero, the plot accurately represents the data without misleading the viewer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scatter Plot\n",
    "A scatter plot is a type of plot that presents values for two variables for a set of data using Cartesian coordinates. The data points are displayed as a collection of points, where one variable's value determines the position on the horizontal axis and the other variable's value determines the position on the vertical axis. When can you use a scatter plot? Let's explore some options:\n",
    "- You can use it for examining the relationship between two continuous variables like temperature and energy consumption.\n",
    "- Investigating patterns or trends in data, such as house prices versus size.\n",
    "- Detecting outliers or unusual observations such as outliers in test scores or abnormal stock behavior.\n",
    "- Visualizing data with many observations to identify clusters or groups and exploring complex data.\n",
    "Outliers significantly impact interpretation, requiring consideration of their inclusion or exclusion. On the screen, the data is plotted with and without outliers. With outliers, it shows two clusters, but removing outliers makes the remaining data more visible. Proper outlier handling enhances accuracy and meaningful insights in scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Box Plot\n",
    "A box plot, also known as a box and whisker plot, is a type of plot that displays the distribution of a dataset along with key statistical measures. It consists of a box, representing the interquartile range (IQR), a line inside the box representing the median, and lines whiskers extending from the box to indicate the range of the data, excluding outliers. Outliers may be represented as individual data points beyond the whiskers. Let's look at some scenarios where box plots come in handy:\n",
    "- While comparing the distribution of a continuous variable across different categories or groups. For example, employees' salaries across departments.\n",
    "- Examining spread and skewness of the dataset.\n",
    "- Visualizing quartiles and outliers, identifying and analyzing potential outliers within a dataset.\n",
    "- Visualizing summary statistics: median, quartiles, range in a concise and informative manner.\n",
    "- Comparing distributions of multiple variables in datasets side by side.\n",
    "Remember, box plots provide valuable information about outliers, such as their presence and extent. Ignoring or mishandling outliers can distort the interpretation of the data and mask important insights, the same as with scatter plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Histogram\n",
    "A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset, showing the frequency or relative frequency of values within specific intervals. It consists of bars, where the height represents the data count in each interval. Histograms offer valuable insights into data distribution, outliers, skewness, and variability. They visually depict the shape of the data, whether it's symmetric, skewed, or bimodal. Skewness can be assessed by examining the histogram's shape. Histograms also showcase data variability, allowing you to observe concentrations, gaps, and clusters that reveal patterns or subgroups. Apart from issues with scale and inadequate labeling, be careful while choosing the bins to create a histogram. We have generated a random dataset and created three histograms, with three different binning options. Too few bins (five, represented in green color), an optimal number of bins (20, represented in blue), and too many bins (50, the yellow one). By comparing these histograms, you can observe how the choice of binning affects the representation of the data distribution and results in a misleading representation of the data. Selecting too few or too many bins can oversimplify or overcomplicate the distribution, respectively.\n",

    "In this video, you learned that there are various types of plots commonly used in data visualization:\n",
    "- Line plots capture trends and changes over time, allowing us to see patterns and fluctuations.\n",
    "- Bar plots compare categories or groups, providing a visual comparison of their values.\n",
    "- Scatter plots explore relationships between variables, helping us identify correlations or trends.\n",
    "- Box plots display the distribution of data, showcasing the median, quartiles, and outliers.\n",
    "- Histograms illustrate the distribution of data within specific intervals, allowing us to understand its shape and concentration.\n"

    "# Introduction to Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the introduction to Matplotlib. After watching this video, you'll be able to explain what Matplotlib is, why it was created, and describe its uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Matplotlib?\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. It was created by John Hunter, an American neurobiologist, as a replacement for proprietary software his research team used for analyzing electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocorticography (ECoG) signals. Initially developed as a tool for EEG and ECoG visualization, Matplotlib evolved into a comprehensive data visualization library akin to Matlab, featuring a scripting interface for quick and easy generation of graphics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uses of Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is versatile and can be integrated into various environments, including:\n",
    "- Python scripts\n",
    "- Python and IPython shells\n",
    "- Web application servers\n",
    "- Graphical user interface (GUI) toolkits\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matplotlib Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib's architecture consists of three main layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Backend Layer\n",
    "- **FigureCanvas**: Defines the area on which the figure is drawn.\n",
    "- **Renderer**: Knows how to draw on the FigureCanvas.\n",
    "- **Event**: Handles user inputs such as keyboard strokes and mouse clicks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Artist Layer\n",
    "The artist layer is where the heavy lifting happens. Everything visible in a Matplotlib figure is an artist instance. There are two types of artist objects:\n",
    "- **Primitive Artists**: `Line2D`, `Rectangle`, `Circle`, `Text`\n",
    "- **Composite Artists**: `Axis`, `Tick`, `Axes`, `Figure`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Scripting Layer\n",
    "The scripting layer, known as `Pyplot`, is suitable for everyday purposes. It simplifies common tasks and allows quick and easy generation of graphics and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating Plots with Pyplot\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pyplot` interface automatically defines a Canvas and a Figure artist instance and connects them. Here's how to generate a histogram of 10,000 random numbers using the scripting layer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "# Generate random data\n",
    "x = np.random.randn(10000)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create histogram\n",
    "plt.hist(x, bins=100)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Show plot\n",
    "plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, `plt.hist` creates a sequence of rectangle artists for each histogram bar and adds them to the Axes container.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of a Plot\n",
    "\n",
    "The anatomy of a plot refers to the various components and elements that make up a visual representation of data. Key components include:\n",
    "- **Figure**: The overall window or canvas containing the plot(s).\n",
    "- **Axes**: The individual plots within a figure, providing scales and tick marks.\n",
    "- **Title**: A summary or explanation of the plot.\n",
    "- **Labels**: Descriptions of the data on each axis.\n",
    "- **Legend**: Explains the meaning of different elements or data series in the plot.\n",
    "- **Grid**: Helps align data points and read values.\n",
    "- **Annotations**: Provide supplemental information or explanations about specific data points or regions in the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize the plot with different symbols, colors, and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more detailed information, refer to the \"Anatomy of a Figure\" section on the official Matplotlib website. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the components and elements that make up a plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video, you learned that Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. It was initially developed as an EEG and ECoG visualization tool. Matplotlib's architecture is composed of three main layers: the backend layer, the artist layer, and the scripting layer. The anatomy of a plot includes various components and elements that make up a visual representation of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading, consider exploring the chapter written by the creators of Matplotlib to learn more about its history and architecture.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Explore how to use Matplotlib to create plots by employing Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "- Create conventional visualization tools using the Plot function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matplotlib is a well-established data visualization library that can be integrated into different environments such as Python scripts, Python and IPython shells, web application servers, and graphical user interface toolkits. The Jupyter Notebook is also one of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, visualizations, and explanatory text. Jupyter has specialized support for Matplotlib, making it easy to start visualizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Started with Jupyter Notebook and Matplotlib\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Create a Plot**:\n",
    "   To plot a circular mark at position (5, 5):\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   plt.plot(5, 5, 'o')\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",

    "   ```python\n",
    "   data = {\n",
    "       'Year': list(range(1980, 1997)),\n",
    "       'India': [1000, 2000, 3000, ...],  # example data\n",
    "       'China': [500, 1500, 2500, ...]   # example data\n",
    "   }\n",
    "   df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Line Plot**:\n",
    "   To plot a line plot for data from India and China:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   df.plot(x='Year', y=['India', 'China'], kind='line')\n",
    "   plt.show()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Histogram**:\n",
    "   To plot a histogram of the India column:\n",
