    "# Classification\n",
    "**Classification Overview:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Classification aims to categorize data points into predefined classes.\n",
    "* It establishes a relationship between a set of features (independent variables) and a target variable (dependent variable) that is categorical in nature.\n",
    "* The core objective is to predict the class label for unseen data points based on a trained classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Workflow:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Phase:**\n",
    "    * A dataset containing labeled data points is used to train the classification model.\n",
    "    * Each data point consists of feature values and a corresponding target label representing the class it belongs to.\n",
    "2. **Prediction Phase:**\n",
    "    * The trained model is presented with an unlabeled data point (test case).\n",
    "    * The model predicts the class label (e.g., defaulter or non-defaulter) for the unlabeled data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classification Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Loan Default Prediction:** Classifying loan applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories based on factors like age, income, and education.\n",
    "* **Medical Diagnosis:** Predicting the appropriate medication for a patient based on their medical history and response to previous treatments. (Multi-class classification)\n",
    "* **Customer Churn Prediction:** Identifying customers at risk of switching to a competitor.\n",
    "* **Marketing Campaign Targeting:** Classifying customers into relevant segments for targeted advertising campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Examples of Classification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email spam filtering\n",
    "* Speech recognition (classifying spoken words)\n",
    "* Handwriting recognition\n",
    "* Biometric identification (e.g., fingerprint or facial recognition)\n",
    "* Document categorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Classification Algorithms:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This video highlights a few commonly used classification algorithms, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Decision Trees\n",
    "* Naive Bayes\n",
    "* Linear Discriminant Analysis\n",
    "* K-Nearest Neighbors\n",
    "* Logistic Regression\n",
    "* Neural Networks\n",
    "* Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "While numerous classification algorithms exist, this course will delve into a select few.\n"

    "Certainly, here are some examples of how 0 and 1 can be used to represent class labels in classification problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Loan Default Prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0: Represents a customer who will repay the loan (good risk).\n",
    "* 1: Represents a customer who is likely to default on the loan (bad risk).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Email Spam Filtering:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0: Represents a legitimate email (not spam).\n",
    "* 1: Represents a spam email.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Image Classification (Black and White Images):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0: Represents a black pixel.\n",
    "* 1: Represents a white pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Medical Diagnosis (Binary Test):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0: Represents a negative test result.\n",
    "* 1: Represents a positive test result.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Customer Churn Prediction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 0: Represents a customer who will remain with the company (not churn).\n",
    "* 1: Represents a customer who is likely to switch to a competitor (churn).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that 0 and 1 are arbitrary assignments and can be reversed depending on the specific classification task. The key takeaway is that these binary labels represent distinct categories within the data."
