    "### Question 1\n",
    "Which of the following examples is/are a sample application of Logistic Regression? (select three)\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Estimating the blood pressure of a patient based on her symptoms and biographical data.\n",
    "- [x] Customer's propensity to purchase a product or halt a subscription in marketing applications.\n",
    "- [x] The probability that a person has a heart attack within a specified time period using person's age and sex.\n",
    "- [x] Likelihood of a homeowner defaulting on a mortgage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "Which of the following statements comparing linear and logistic regressions is TRUE?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [x] Linear regression is used for a continuous target whereas logistic regression is more suitable for a categorical target.\n",
    "- [ ] Independent variables in linear regression can be continuous or categorical, but can only be categorical in logistic regression.\n",
    "- [ ] In this course, linear regression minimizes the mean absolute error, while logistic regression minimizes the mean squared error.\n",
    "- [ ] Both linear and logistic regression can be used to predict categorical responses and attain a pointâ€™s likelihood of belonging to each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "How are gradient descent and learning rate used in logistic regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "- [ ] Gradient descent will minimize learning rate to minimize the cost in fewer iterations.\n",
    "- [ ] Gradient descent takes increasingly bigger steps towards the minimum with each iteration.\n",
    "- [ ] We want to minimize the cost by maximizing the learning rate value.\n",
    "- [x] Gradient descent specifies the steps to take in the current slope direction, learning rate is the step length.\n",
